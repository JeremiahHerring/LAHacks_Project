## What it Does 🌟
StudyDino is able to customize the experience of students based off their mental and academic needs using the incredible AI model, Gemini. The purpose of StudyDino is to simplify and assist students who struggle academically due to mental health issues, creating personalized study plans. StudyDino provides broad range of potential struggles students may face, allowing the students to take control and choose all the struggles they feel they face. Additionally, StudyDino also takes into account the time frame of which the student feels they need to study for. StudyDino then allows the user to submit the coursework they would like to study such as a PowerPoint, lecture notes, or a syllabus (anything)! Taking all the information it's been given, this web app provides an incredibly personalized study plan the user can follow. It outlines the timeframe of which the user should study for each particular section, breaks down the topics, and provides tips on approaches they can take alongside advice to help students based on the struggles they said they faced.
